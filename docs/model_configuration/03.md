In this example, we are going to run a simple `python` code. 

```bash
$ python hello.py Fling output.txt
Created the file output.txt
```


This code creates a file `.txt`
```bash
Hello Fling!
```

### Creating your first configuration

To create it, you need:

- Number of inputs
- Number of outputs
- Number of parameters
- Language/framework of your code


In this example, the command will be

```bash
$ mic model_configuration [create/add/init] hello_world -i 0 -o 1 -p 1 -l python3
SUCCESS

To add more information about your Model Configuration use:
$ mic model_configuration edit hello_world/
```

MIC has created a directory `hello_world`. 
You must put your code. But don't worry about it now. 
Let's go to add more metadata.
