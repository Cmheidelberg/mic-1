It's time to validate your component.

If you don't want to test the Docker Image, add the option `--no-docker`

```bash
$ mic model_configuration validate hello_world --no-docker
```

But we totally recommend to it.

The validation process is going to validate:
- Metadata match with the run file
- The execution on your machine
- The creation of the Docker Image
- The execution on your machine using Docker

```bash
$ mic model_configuration validate hello_world/
[OK] Metadata match with the run file
[OK] Execution without Docker
[OK] Extraction of dependencies
[OK] Build Docker Image
[OK] Execution using Docker

Created: hello_world/hello_world.zip
```

The result is going to be a sharable zip file.
